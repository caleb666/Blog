To depict an example how delegates are used in event handling, we'll create a Console application, that prints numbers from 0 to 9.
This app will raise events when counting starts and when it ends.

First thing we'll do is to define 2 delegates, which will handle start and finish events:



[code language=csharp]
public delegate void CountStartedEventHandler(string _message);
public delegate void CountFinishedEventHandler(string _message);
[/code]

The method which will be attached to these events will simply print the message to Console:

[code language=csharp]
static void sendMessage(string _msg)
{
            Console.WriteLine(_msg);
}
[/code]

The definition of <em><strong>Counter</strong> </em>class resembles the following code:

[code language=csharp]
 public class Counter
        {

            //define events for start and finish
            //notice, that events return a delegate
            public event CountStartedEventHandler CountStart;
            public event CountFinishedEventHandler CountFinished;

            public void Count()
            {
                //call function that will handle delegate calls
                OnCountStart(); 

                for (int a = 0; a < 10; a++)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(a);
                    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
                }

                //call function that will handle delegate calls
                //and pass the values
                OnCountFinished();  
            }

            private void OnCountStart()
            {
                //create a delegate
                CountStartedEventHandler delStart = CountStart;

                if (delStart != null)
                {
                    //this is where real event handling action takes place.
                    //appropriate method arguments are pushed through a delegate to 
                    //connected methods
                    //notice that this class knows nothing about this method
                    //it just pushes the parameter
                    //all necessary plumbing is connected during runtime.
                    //And this is good, because it provides encapsulation
                    //and allows this class to be used in different scenarios,
                    //without modifying it
                    delStart("Count Started!");

                    //Our example is very simple and only pushes message to print.
                    //But if we take for instance - mousemove event:
                    //The same scenario will take place every time 
                    //system registers new mouse coordinates and pushes them
                    //as the event arguments
                    //to the appropriate method, which will decide what to do next.
                }
            }

            private void OnCountFinished()
            {
                CountFinishedEventHandler delFinished = CountFinished;

                if (delFinished != null)
                {
                    delFinished("Count Finished!");
                }
            }
        }
[/code]

And one more thing left to do is to initialize <em><strong>Counter</strong> </em>instance and connect <em><strong>sendMessage</strong> </em>method to <em><strong>CountStart</strong> </em>and <em><strong>CountFinished</strong></em> events.

[code language=csharp]
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            //initialize counter object
            Counter counter = new Counter();

            //define which methods will handle CountStart and CountFinished events
            counter.CountStart += sendMessage;
            counter.CountFinished += sendMessage;

            //start counting
            counter.Count();

            Console.ReadLine();

        }
[/code]

The result of running our app will resemble the following screen:

<h3>Using Custom EventArgs to pass event arguments</h3>
The code presented above is OK, but if we need to pass more arguments than a single message, we'll have to add this functionality.
And this is a scenario, when <em><strong>CustomEventArgs</strong> </em>should be used, because it allows to pass unlimited amount of arguments.

You probably seen usage of <em><strong>EventArgs </strong></em>many times in event handlers definition:
For example:

[code language=csharp]
public void Button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e){}
[/code]

So let's define our <em><strong>CustomEventArgs</strong> </em>class, which will contain properties representing event generation DateTime and message:

[code language=csharp]
public class CustomEventArgs : System.EventArgs
{
	 public DateTime eventDate { get; set; }
         public string message { get; set; }
}
[/code]

No matter how many properties will be encapsulated into our <em><strong>CustomEventArgs</strong></em>, they will always be passed properly to the destination methods thanks to <em><strong>System.EventArgs</strong></em> class, which is inherited by <em><strong>CustomEventArgs</strong> </em>class.

We'll also need to change <em><strong>sendMessage</strong> </em>method to receive <em><strong>CustomEventArgs</strong> </em>object and to display event time and message:

[code language=csharp]
static void sendMessage(object sender, CustomEventArgs e)
{
      Console.WriteLine(
          String.Format("eventDate: {0}, message: {1}", e.eventDate, e.message));
}
[/code]

And also, inside <em><strong>Counter</strong> </em>class, event raising code must be changed accordingly:

[code language=csharp]
delStart(this,  new CustomEventArgs(){ 
         eventDate = System.DateTime.Now, 
         message= "Count Started!"} 
);
[/code]

In this code, we are passing <em><strong>this</strong> </em>- as the reference to the object raising event (this is of course object of type <em><strong>Counter</strong></em>) and creating <em><strong>CustomEventArgs</strong> </em>object where values are assigned inline.

After running the app once again, the result will resemble this screen:
<img   src="https://mikewaniewski.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/console4.png" />

<h3>EventHandler &lt;T&gt;</h3>
We can make our code even shorter, taking advantage of .NET Framework generic types.
Generic types are one of the most powerful features of .NET. They allow to connect types to places defined by placeholder (where T is type name). And these types are not known until runtime.

This delegate and event definition:

[code language=csharp]
public delegate void CountStartedEventHandler(object sender, CustomEventArgs e);
public event CountFinishedEventHandler CountFinished;
[/code]

can be substituted with:

[code language=csharp]
public event EventHandler<CustomEventArgs> CountFinished;
[/code]

which is a built-in delegate that generates the delegate behind the scenes.

If you hover over EventHandler definition in VisualStudio - you'll see the following:
<img   src="https://mikewaniewski.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/vshover.png"   />

This information tells us, that we'll be calling

[code language=csharp]
delegate System.EventHandler<TEventArgs>
[/code]

So this delegate awaits for any type derived from <em><strong>EventArgs</strong></em>

Also, when we use this delegate later, the code must be changed from:

[code language=csharp]
CountFinishedEventHandler delFinished = CountFinished;
[/code]

to:

[code language=csharp]
EventHandler<CustomEventArgs> delFinished = CountFinished;
[/code]

This approach is faster, but requires you to understand what's happening.
And it's good for events only.
If you need to use delegate in other scenarios - then you should use the previous approach.
