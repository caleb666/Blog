I always like to save time by automating tasks, especially if I need to perform these tasks very frequently.

An example of such task is updating my project from the main repository and deploying it to the server.

Normally it takes 10-15 clicks to do, and the same amount of seconds if doing it fast - before the actual deployment starts.

How about changing it all to 1 click.

I did it this way, using VBScript:

[code]
Option Explicit
Dim wshShell
On Error Resume Next
   Set wshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WSCript.shell")
   If Err.Number <> 0 Then
      Wscript.Quit
   End If
   wshShell.Run  "cmd.exe /C cd C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin>TortoiseProc.exe & TortoiseProc.exe /command:update /path:""d:\MY_PROJECT_FOLDER\"" /closeonend:1"

   
   Set wshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WSCript.shell")
   If Err.Number <> 0 Then
      Wscript.Quit
   End If
   wshShell.Run  "cmd.exe /C cd C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319  &  msbuild.exe C:\MY_PROJECT_FOLDER\MY_PROJECT.sln /p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:PublishProfile=myPublishProfile"
On Error Goto 0

[/code]

This script can later be saved as <em><strong>deploymentScript.vbs</strong></em> (Visual Basic Script) and fired anytime from console or shortcut.
